# fractal-dimension-calculator
A fractal Dimension calculator wrote in Mathematica. It provides tools to compute the minkowski-bouligand dimension of an image.

I added some tools to cut and crop the image in order to get better results in the Mathematica notebook.

In this repository, the old project written in Processing is still avaible, though it's broken, don't use that unless your a mathemagician and you know how to fix it.
